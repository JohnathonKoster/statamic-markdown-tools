# Markdown Tools for Statamic

The Markdown Tools addon is simply a collection of modifiers for the generated markdown output. These can be used to accomplish the following:

* Minify the generated output before it's sent to your visitors;
* Convert LeanPub Markua style blocks (like errors, warnings, etc) into nicely formatted HTML blocks (convenient if you write a lot using the Markua/LeanPub flavored markdown syntax);
* More to surely come in the future!

## Installation

Copy the `MarkdownTools` folder into your `site/addons` folder. That should be all you have to do.

## Configuration

There will be more information on this later!
